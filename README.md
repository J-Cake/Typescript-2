# Typescript-2
A lot of us love TypeScript, but a major issue with it is it does not do runtime type checking, only compile time, which means that if a function returns a number when it's variable is set to string, the compiler will compile, and does not constrain the type correctly. TypeScript 2 does runtime type checking as well as providing a custom syntax and options to execute the output code immediately. Trust me, it's just better.
